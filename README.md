# Shopping Cart

  

This is my first project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a basic shopping cart interface where users can add or remove items and see the total price of the selected items.

  

## Features

  

-  **Shopping Cart Interface**: Display of products with images, prices, quantities, and totals.

-  **Interactive Quantity Adjustment**: Users can increase or decrease the quantity of each product, and the total price updates accordingly.

-  **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

  

## Technologies Used

  

-  **HTML**: Structure of the web page.

-  **CSS**: Styling of the shopping cart.

-  **JavaScript**: Logic to handle item quantity updates and price calculations.

-  **Bootstrap**: For responsive layout and basic styling.

-  **Font Awesome**: For icons used in the cart (e.g., plus and minus buttons).

  

## Getting Started

  

To view and interact with the shopping cart:

  

1. Clone the repository:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shopping-cart.git
```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How  It  Works  

- The shopping cart initially displays two products with a default quantity of  0. 
 - Users can increase the quantity of each product by clicking the plus icon and decrease it 
 with the minus icon.
 - The total price for each product and the overall subtotal is updated dynamically 
 as items are added or removed.
